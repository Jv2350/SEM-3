OS Bot COLOR (OSBC) is a desktop client for controlling and monitoring automation scripts for games. This application is paired with a toolkit for writing new scripts. Unlike popular automation frameworks that modify/inject code into a game's client, OSBC is completely hands-off; it uses a combination of color detection, image recognition, and optical character recognition to navigate the game. The goal of OSBC is to provide a fun and educational learning experience for new & seasoned developers alike, emphasizing the exploration of automation technologies and not to encourage or support activities that are in violation of any game's Terms of Service.

# Developer Setup <img height=20 src="documentation/media/windows_logo.png"/>
1. Install [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3109/) *(not compatible with other major versions)*
2. Clone/download this repository
3. Open the project folder in your IDE of choice (Visual Studio Code recommended)
4. Open the repository folder in a terminal window
   1. Create a virtual environment ```py -3.10 -m venv env```
   2. Activate the newly created virtual environment ```.\env\Scripts\activate```
   3. Install the depedencies ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
5. Run `./src/*OSBC.py*` *(may need to restart IDE for it to recognize installed dependencies)*

# Documentation

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/kelltom/OSRS-Bot-COLOR/wiki) for tutorials, and software design information.

# Features
## User Interface
OSBC offers a clean interface for configuring, running, and monitoring your Python bots. For developers, this means that all you need to do is write a bot's logic loop, and *the UI is already built for you*.

### Script Log
The Script Log provides a clean and simple way to track your bot's progress. No more command line clutter!

```python
self.log_msg("The bot has started.")
```

### Simple Option Menus
OSBC allows developers to create option menus and parse user selections with ease.

```python
def create_options(self):
  ''' Declare what should appear when the user opens the Options menu '''
  self.options_builder.add_slider_option("running_time", "How long to run (minutes)?", 1, 180)
  self.options_builder.add_text_edit_option("text_edit_example", "Text Edit Example", "Placeholder text here")
  self.options_builder.add_checkbox_option("multi_select_example", "Multi-select Example", ["A", "B", "C"])
  self.options_builder.add_dropdown_option("menu_example", "Menu Example", ["A", "B", "C"])
```

## Human-like Mouse Movement
OSBC uses Bezier curves to create smooth, human-like mouse movements.

## Object Detection
Using color isolation, OSBC can quickly locate objects/NPCs outlined by solid colors and extract their properties into simple data structures.

## Random Click Distribution
With the help of the OSBC community, we've created a randomization algorithm that distributes clicks in a way that is more human-like.

## Efficient Image Searching
Sometimes, your bot might need to find a specific image on screen. We've modified OpenCV's template matching algorithm to be more efficient and reliable with UI elements and sprites - even supporting images with transparency.

## Lightning Fast Optical Character Recognition
We've ditched machine learned OCR in favor of a much faster and more reliable custom implementation. OSBC can locate text on screen in as little as **2 milliseconds**. That's **0.002 seconds**.
